Contributions of this Research:
(1) Designing and developing a Halbach cylinder that can generate uniform magnet field density inside.
(2) Establishing an analytical framework for the general Halbach-array-based two-phase motor that can produce constant torque
(3) Proposing a high-precision position sensing method based on Hall-effect sensors
(4) Designing and implementing a controller to achieve precision position control.
